# Macro-Pong

Pong game made with Macroquad using Rust programming language. My goal with this project was to learn how to create games with very basic and minimal game library.

For Windows users, just download the zip from releases and run the macro-pong.exe. Linux and Mac users should be easily git clone and build the project with "cargo build".
